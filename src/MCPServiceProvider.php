 *
 * Services registered:
 * - MCPServerInterface -> FastMCP (singleton)
 * - TransportFactory (singleton)
 * - LoopInterface -> React EventLoop (singleton)
 * - MCPServerCommand (singleton)
 *
 * Configuration:
 * - Publishes config/mcp.php to the application's config directory
 * - Configuration can be customized through the published config file
 *
 * Commands:
 * - mcp:server: Starts the MCP server with the configured transport
